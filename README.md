### Introduction

**What is Akiba Starknet?**

Akiba Starknet is a  savings platform that transforms traditional saving methods into a blockchain-based system. It enables users to convert their savings into digital tokens. These digital tokens represent the user's commitment to their savings goal and can be redeemed upon completion of the savings plan.

### Key Features

* **NFT-Based Savings:** Users can deposit funds into the app and receive NFT tokens representing their savings commitment. NFTs are unique and non-transferable, ensuring that they cannot be sold or traded on external markets.
* **Scheduled Savings:** Users can set up scheduled savings plans, specifying the amount and frequency of deposits. The app incentivizes users to stick to their savings schedule by applying penalties for early withdrawals.
* **Penalty and Reward System:** Users who withdraw from their savings plan before the scheduled end date incur small penalties. Penalties collected from defaulters are redistributed among users who successfully complete their savings plans.


### Getting Started

### How It Works

1. **Registration:** Users create an account and set up a digital wallet.
2. **Funding:** Users deposit funds into their wallet.
3. **Savings:** Users can set up scheduled savings plans or save at their own pace. NFTs representing their savings commitments are issued.
4. **Penalties and Rewards:** Users who withdraw early incur penalties, which are shared with committed savers.
5. **Redemption:** At the end of the savings plan, users can exchange their NFTs for the saved amount minus any penalties incurred.



### Revenue Model

We generate revenue through transaction fees when users exchange their NFTs for savings. Additionally, a portion of penalties collected from defaulters contributes to our revenue.


### User Support

User support and educational resources to help users understand and make the most of Akiba Starknet will be provided.

### Future Improvements

 Future updates may include enhanced features, improved security, and expanded investment options.
